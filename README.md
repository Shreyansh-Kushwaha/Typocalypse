## üìñ About The Project

Typing Adventure is an interactive game designed to make practicing typing fun. Forget boring, repetitive drills. Here, you are the hero of a story that unfolds as you type.

At each step of the journey, a new part of the narrative is presented. Your task is to type it out accurately. Once you succeed, you'll be faced with choices that determine where the story goes next. The entire experience is designed to keep you engaged while your fingers fly across the keyboard, naturally improving your words-per-minute (WPM) and accuracy.
